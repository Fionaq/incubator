incubator
=========

A place for spawning and discussing ideas for sites/apps before diving in and building

## Ok, exciting, what now?

1. Create a new folder for each distinct idea. 
2. Give that folder a descriptive title, so that your app/project name can be determined later.
3. Every folder should have a ReadMe that gives an overview of the idea. Guideline for contents below.
4. Create extra documents and resources as needed.
5. If the idea spawns its own github repo, be sure to link it in the ReadMe.

### Suggested format for the ReadMe

- Overview - the idea in a couple of sentences
- Link to repo and/or website
- Minimum viable implementation feature list _(don't add nice-to-haves to this list!)_
- Tech spec basics (platforms, programming languages, infrastructure)
- Active contributors with twitter handles where available
  - users
  - build team
- Current top naming suggestions (useful as a sanity check for your minimum viable implementation)
- TODO list of next-steps, separated into at least
  - technical
  - user research
  - user testing
  - visual design
  - text
