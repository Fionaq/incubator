Hey Doc, this is me normally!
=========

Here's my password, look me up and in 30 - 60 seconds of video get a sense of what 'normal for me' is like.

Oh, and some of that annoying stuff like my NHS numbers, next of kin, allergies and a list of my other doctors.

#### Why?

When you meet a doctor or nurse, often you're acutely unwell, and you're just "not yourself".
Giving medical staff a quick glimpse of what you're like when you're well is more powerful than anything you can describe.
For older people, a video that shows doctors and nurses what they were like in mind, body _and spirit_ before this acute episode could be extra valuable.

A video of 'me on a good day' is also a great way to help HCPs make a relationship with us that respects who we are beyond being a patient.

### Minimum viable implementation feature list 
_(don't add nice-to-haves to this list!)_

1. 30-60 seconds of video (not about your health - it's a 'me on a good day' video)
2. Ability to create and maintain a secure account
3. Password-based access for an outsider to view your account
4. Basic text information (that you control)
  - NHS Number
  - Contact details
  - Next of kin
  - Allergies
  - Medications 
    - quick list (for excluding clashes/side effects)  
    - regime (times, doses, strengths)
  - List of other people involved in your care
    - with contact details
    - including specialists, school nurses, therapists etc
  - Other notes
    - free text section that we can use to inform next features
5. Doc can save/delete shortcuts to profiles (but can _only_ view online)
6. Users can store the profile's they own locally to view offline

### Tech spec basics 
_(platforms, programming languages, infrastructure)_

- web (for uploading, editing)
- iPhone
- Android
- Dual develop in AS3 initially to get xPlatform prototype?

### Current top naming suggestions 
_useful as a sanity check for your minimum viable implementation_

### TODO list of next-steps
- technical
- user research
  - get reaction input from Kaz & Dominic
  - get reaction input from some Drs
  - distill to minimum viable implementation feature list
  - cross check MVI with users
- user testing
- visual design
- text
